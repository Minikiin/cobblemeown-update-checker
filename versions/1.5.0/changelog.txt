Notable changes:
- Quality of Life PC changes (Cobblemon UI Tweaks mod)
- Items dropped animation for fun
- Added more pokemon w/ OdysseyMons and WaviMons
(make sure to enable them in resourcepacks to work clientside, also remove the old cobblecats.zip pack from your resourcepacks, and enable the new CobbleCats 1.5 one)
