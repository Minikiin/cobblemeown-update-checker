I recommend viewing the actual changelog on Modrinth

Notable changes:
- Replaced SimpleTMs with Where Are My TMs
- Added a simple Pokedex (shift right click on a Pokemon)
- Gym Leaders/badges progression has slightly changed
- Individual trainer skins (finally, those clones were getting old.. credit to matcher_ from Discord)
- Cleaned up shaderpacks selection
- Fixed hover text not showing on Multiplayer screen (thanks, EpicOOF)
